# Difference between Android compileSdkVersion, minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion

**minSdkVersion <= targetSdkVersion <= compileSdkVersion**
 
Ideally, the relationship would look more like this in the steady state:

**minSdkVersion (lowest possible) <= targetSdkVersion == compileSdkVersion (latest SDK)**

Youâ€™ll hit the biggest audience with a low minSdkVersion and look and act the best by targeting and compiling with the latest SDK.
